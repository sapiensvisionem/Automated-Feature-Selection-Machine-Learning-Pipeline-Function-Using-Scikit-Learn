# Automated-Feature-Selection-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-Function-Using-Scikit-Learn
custom made function to automate feature selection process and pipeline it with machine learning model of choice using scikit-learn

Using Scikit Learn, I created a function in which a user specifies a feature selection method of choice and model user would like to use. Then, it automatically performs grid search on the model. 

This is different from another function in that it does not run every model but only one model of user's choice.
